# node-mysql

* Here I've created an app that will give users an amazon-like opportunity to buy items online.
* I've used Node.js and MySql databases to create this app.
* Upon execution, the user will be shown all available products and their costs along with departments.
* The user will then be asked which item they'd like to buy along with the quantity they'd like to buy.
* If the quantity requested is less than what's available in stock, the order will go through and the user will be shown a success message.
    * The user requested quantity will then be reduced from the database/store quantity (stock).
* If the quantity is insufficient, the user will receive an insufficient quantity message.



* Tool used :  Node packages = "inquirer", "mysql", "cli-table"   ; MySQL database
*  MySQL stores the inventor data and the mysql node package is used to interact with the database locally.  The inquirer package is used to interact with the user/customer through prompts and the cli-table is used to display the inventory in a clean way.

*  Please check out my review video located in the link below.
